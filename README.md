- 👋 Hi, I’m @Espresso-6 aka Caleb
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, web development and interface design for websites and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D modeling using Autodesk's 3DS Max, as well as web design principles such as Jakob's Law.

- 🎮 My hobbies include gaming, listening to rock music, investigating new technoloogies, finding faster ways of doing things and spending way too
     much time preparing food.
